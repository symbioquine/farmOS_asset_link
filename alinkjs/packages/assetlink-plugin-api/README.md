Welcome to the documentation for Asset Link!

Asset Link is a highly extensible mobile app for farmOS, which aims to connect users with their farmOS data via a minimal action-driven
user interface.

If you are new to Asset Link in general, check out the [user guide](tutorial-user-guide.html).

Next, the [writing plugins tutorial](tutorial-writing-plugins.html) is a good place to begin understanding how to extend Asset Link.
